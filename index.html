	thank you for considering me as a candidate for the position I applied for.
	Please feel free to browser around and look at my projects, which are posted
	on their appropriate pages on the menu bar above, and have an excellent rest 
	of your day.

	I hope you appreciated my brief into, and here is more insight into who I am and why I do my
		projects. I come from a family where all that I knew was trucking and medicine,  		, until I took my first coding class my freshman 
		year in high school. I feel in love with the idea of programming due to having a professor who focused
		on teaching us to learn why a program works instead of what syntax is necessary to make it work. With that alone I felt thrilled when I was finally able to comprehend why the cash register program I made could recall the grocery items I stored when a user entered their name or appropiate number. 
		After that course, I continued with programming by taking courses each year that covered computer architecure, data structures, and other languages. 
		With each course I continued to take my mind shifted away from medicine, and lead me to explore 
		engineering and the vast projects available for anyone to do to learn and improve new skills. 
		Hence, what drew to programming and engineering was purley my curiousity and I hope everyone
		continues to explore and attempt even the most difficult projects not to fault them, 
		but to find your interests.
